## Hi there 👋

<!--

The following program in the C programming language defines a function that is named "SalesTax" and has one parameter named "price". The type of price is "double" (i.e. a double-precision floating point number). The function's return type is also a double.

double SalesTax(double price)
{
  return 0.05 * price;
}
After the function has been defined, it can be invoked as follows:

SalesTax(10.00);
In this example, the function has been invoked with the argument 10.00. When this happens, 10.00 will be assigned to price, and the function begins calculating its result. The steps for producing the result are specified below, enclosed in {}. 0.05 * price indicates that the first thing to do is multiply 0.05 by the value of price, which gives 0.50. return means the function will produce the result of 0.05 * price. Therefore, the final result (ignoring possible round-off errors one encounters with representing decimal fractions as binary fractions) is 0.50.
